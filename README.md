# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions to the coding challenges from [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

All solutions are coded with JavaScript, using Node v10.16.0. 

You don't need to clone the repository to read through the solutions code. Each solution is commented and has an associated Wiki post which explains my thought process as I solved the challenge.

## Running a solution

Firstly, clone the repository to your computer.

Then open a command line window (Terminal for Mac, Command prompt or Powershell for Windows) and run:

```
cd path/to/repository/solutions
node day1-part1.js
```
